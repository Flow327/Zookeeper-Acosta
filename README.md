This project is offered by Hyperskillz. It involves creating a virtual zoo with various animals. 
Each animal has specific characteristics and needs that have to be taken care of. The project uses Kotlin, as the programming language, to perform tasks such as feeding animals, checking their habitats, and providing the right environment for them.
